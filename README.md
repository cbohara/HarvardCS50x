# Harvard_CS50

I have completed the problem sets for the first half of CS50 in order to learn about the fundamentals of computer science including "abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, (and) software engineering." The second half of CS50 is dedicated to web development so I have opted out of the problem sets but gained valuable knowledge by watching the lectures.
